# Flight Ticket Price Prediction
In this project, our aim is to help users determine the cheapest time to travel by predicting what the cost of their flight ticket will be.
To accomplish this, we scraped our price data from Kayak and used it to train our machine learning model to predict the price of flight tickets.
For our dataset, we will be focusing on the time period from June 1st 2023 to August 31st 2023.
Our flights will depart from LAX and arrive at the following airports : HNL, JFK, DEN, DFW, SFO, CHI, ATL
